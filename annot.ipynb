It’s fantastic that you’re interested in learning about programming, tech, UX, and accessibility – those are all really important and exciting areas. \\n\\nDon’t worry about your English being basic, we’ll take it slow and I’ll explain everything clearly.  It’s perfectly okay to ask questions, and honestly, that’s the best way to learn. \\n\\nSo, you’re interested in these topics – programming, tech, UX, and accessibility. That’s great! \\n\\nTo start, can you tell me a little bit about what you already know, or what you *want* to know about them?  For example:\\n\\n*   **Programming:** Have you ever heard of programming languages like Python or JavaScript?\\n*   **Tech:** Are you interested in computers, smartphones, the internet, or something specific?\\n*   **UX (User Experience):** Have you ever thought about how websites or apps *feel* to use?\\n*   **Accessibility:** Have you ever wondered how to make things easier for people with disabilities?\\n\\nDon’t worry about using perfect English. Just speak naturally, and I’ll help you along the way.  Let’s start with whatever you’re most curious about.  What’s on your mind, Jason?'"
